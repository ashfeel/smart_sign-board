The Smart Sign Boards project uses IoT with a master-slave Bluetooth system. The master unit on the signboard sends alerts to the slave unit in vehicles. As a car approaches, the Bluetooth connects, displaying relevant signboard information on the vehicle's LCD. This timely communication enhances driver awareness and road safety.
